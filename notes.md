TODO:

x separate model from views
bundle external systems and only show them on certain views
finegrained management of dependency links (i.e. only show first or second order ones)
x easily define differnt views
easily remove external ones
Introduce something like an importance parameter and filter on that
Think about defining groups dynamically
x Introduce management for different workspaces (to enable the above)
Services connected with everything should not show edges and should be grouped into one (see above)
